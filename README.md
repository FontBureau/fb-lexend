# fb-lexend
History: Began as expansion of the existing family of styles into an OT1.8 weight axis (wght) for design use. 
Additional work was then done to add this variable font with a wght axis to a variable version of the Lexend width axis. 
Arabic is being added to the glyph repertoire in a separate effort. 

Notes: 
1. wght 400 is now more appropriate for body text. Former Regular is wght 500.
2. experimental SPACE and XTRA axes, the "ingredients" of the original width axes, are in /sources
